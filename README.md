# String-Class

Most up to date and polished version of the dozens of string classes I've tried to implement. It works well for the most part, but there is an issue with large strings (hundreds of characters long) being concatenated that cause overflow error. This will be fixed shortly, but I'd rather have this up here for now due to it working perfectly otherwise.
